Program performs analytical and numerical calculation for photon flux density emitted by an oscillating superconducting
quantum interference device (SQUID)-terminated coplanar waveguide. Produces plot.

Calculation reproduced from "Dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting microwave circuits" by Johansson et. al. (2010)
(see figure 8).
